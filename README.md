#FoodLoop
Project Overview
FoodLoop is a community-focused web application designed to help reduce food waste in Louisiana while supporting individuals, families, and shelters that experience food insecurity. The platform connects three groups: local businesses donating surplus food, volunteers who assist with distribution, and individuals or families who need food support. Our goal is to build a tool that is simple to use, helps people access food more easily, and gives donors a safe and organized way to share surplus items.
FoodLoop offers a structured signup system that separates users by role so each person sees features that match their needs. Business owners and volunteers complete one type of signup, while individuals in need complete another. Once registered, users can log in, view their profile, request or donate food, and navigate through resources that support food access in Louisiana.
The website also provides an educational history page explaining food waste in Louisiana, a resource page that directs users to nearby food pantries, and a FAQ page that answers common questions. To promote safe food sharing, all donors, individuals, and shelters sign liability agreements so FoodLoop is not responsible for illness or issues that may occur from donated food. Volunteers can also choose to help deliver food to individuals who cannot travel.
Each page includes a consistent navigation bar to make the interface easy to understand for people of all ages and backgrounds.
